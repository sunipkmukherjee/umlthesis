The package is divided into separate files. You can modify the file 
names and the basic contents (such as headers) in the files themselves. 
The style is mainly dictated by the file `main.tex`, but each chapter 
files also include style information for the chapter headers etc.

Use the following sequence to compile:
```
pdflatex main
bibtex main
pdflatex main
pdflatex main
```

The bibliography goes in the file `ref.bib`.
